# Phase plane
Source code for creating the simplified* phase planes used in the project. 
Exemplary plots for variations of K can be found in the plots folder.

*(Simplified because instead of ploting the entire vector field we only consider the nullclines, i.e. the curves of zero change, and look at the equilibria to determine their stability)
